Hey there!

My name is Omar, and I love learning new things, meeting new people, and discovering new places.
I jot down my experience (or lack of) in this blog.

Most of my articles are on tech, but I may write on whatever is currently on my hasty mind. 
You can reach me at [omarmsqt@gmail.com](mailto:omarmsqt@gmail.com).
Happy reading and happy life :)
